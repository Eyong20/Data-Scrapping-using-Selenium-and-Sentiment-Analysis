I don’t know why I still held on to this. It’s cheesy and we only dated for 3 months happy to trade it in. We met on an app and if I could take that swipe back I would. The most rushed and possibly awkward three months and this is my souvenir.  He didn’t have a particular reason for getting and just chucked it at me. Fun times. I guess I held on to it as a lesson to not waste my time. ,https://media.rtm.com/thegreatexchange/large/9f48ee0b-46ba-4303-b098-7bb6f4510666.jpeg,https://media.rtm.com/thegreatexchange/large/9f48ee0b-46ba-4303-b098-7bb6f4510666.jpeg,CLOTHING

I broke up with my ex boyfriend 10 days ago. Finally managed to let go off a relationship I was putting all my heart into because I thought we would get married. I put aside the fact that it was a long toxic relationship and my boyfriend did not want it to end because he enjoys being loved but doesn’t care to show any love back. I’d like to exchange this soft toy marking an end of 6 years. ,https://media.rtm.com/thegreatexchange/large/03947b87-a222-4bc9-8480-436e0d218188.jpeg,https://media.rtm.com/thegreatexchange/large/03947b87-a222-4bc9-8480-436e0d218188.jpeg,CLOTHING
My ex gave me this custom stained glass art of the two of us about a month before we broke up for my birthday. She very unceremoniously dumped me after I got into a car accident on my way to see her and now a year later we live in the same city and don’t speak. I’d consider it an improvement after all - she’s an ex for a reason.,https://media.rtm.com/thegreatexchange/large/f5a3947f-6a4c-485c-bd2e-925845325ee0.jpeg,https://media.rtm.com/thegreatexchange/large/f5a3947f-6a4c-485c-bd2e-925845325ee0.jpeg,BIRTHDAY
I got this bear from an ex. I got it a bit after Valentine's one year because he got it on sale. This is one of the only gifts he gave me since he was a notorious cheapskate. He would be unwilling to pay for things and I would often have to offer to pay. We didn't last long after that. ,https://media.rtm.com/thegreatexchange/large/546805ff-ea6e-4540-bec1-14185ad9fb8d.jpeg,https://media.rtm.com/thegreatexchange/large/546805ff-ea6e-4540-bec1-14185ad9fb8d.jpeg,VALENTINE

The fellow I got engaged to when we were in college gave me this necklace. When we split up - we were just too young to choose someone to spend the rest of our lives with - he asked for the ring back. I didn't mind giving it back. But I was glad to keep this. It's been more than 40 years. We both married other people and lost touch. I rarely wear it but it's a sweet reminder of young love.,https://media.rtm.com/thegreatexchange/large/36b674c9-33e4-4522-84c3-a946c68d7d35.jpeg,https://media.rtm.com/thegreatexchange/large/36b674c9-33e4-4522-84c3-a946c68d7d35.jpeg,JEWELARY

"Ode To A Too Risque Red Leather Dress

One Valentines Day I was filled with cheer
when my husband gave me a red leather dress just like this one here.
I looked at it  my mouth agape  &
when words fell out 
I had to say 'Darling I love the red color and the fact that its leather but whats remiss 
I could only wear this red leather dress 
If I sang for KISS!

Kept this miniature crocheted chameleon on a branch from my ex. He asked me my favorite animal and why and I didn’t know what to choose so I said a chameleon for some reason… maybe because they were shapeshifters and I thought that was a fun super power. Anyway. Christmas comes around… a few months later the only thing that remains of us is this lil guy. ,https://media.rtm.com/thegreatexchange/large/eb41d0ef-de71-42d6-b3c8-2ff6563fc127.jpeg,https://media.rtm.com/thegreatexchange/large/eb41d0ef-de71-42d6-b3c8-2ff6563fc127.jpeg,CHRISTMAS
"We had been together for a few years and were heading to Vegas! 
Secretly I was wishing for a visit to the chapel.   
We laughed and had so much fun together unfortunately no chapel.  
We did however find this fun little bell to announce our happy hours then one day the happy hours sadly came and end. 
 I kept the bell and now ring it alone with fond memories of what might have been. ",https://media.rtm.com/thegreatexchange/large/35a3b31e-3c68-4940-a572-176ea3d23e89.jpeg,https://media.rtm.com/thegreatexchange/large/35a3b31e-3c68-4940-a572-176ea3d23e89.jpeg,JEWELARY

Ex thought They had such great taste and wanted to help improve my decorating of my place. He would randomly find things while out and about that he thought would be better than what I currently had.

My ex ordered this necklace for me to match a ring that I have and when it came in one of the stones was a little off in color.

At our nieces wedding in Sept 2021 he flirted with one of the bridesmaids. Thought nothing of it. We came home and I overheard him telling his dad he didn’t want to be married anymore. My 15 year old daughter found out this Christmas they have been seeing each other since winter of 2021. Needless to say I’m filling for divorce and I could use a drink. ,https://media.rtm.com/thegreatexchange/large/94dece8f-60fe-42bf-9558-d27832bc8ddb.jpeg,https://media.rtm.com/thegreatexchange/large/94dece8f-60fe-42bf-9558-d27832bc8ddb.jpeg,DIVORCE

These are a much loved favorite pair of fuzzy slippers. The second she walked in the door her shoes came off and the slippers went on. I’m shocked she left them here.

Right before my 33 year relationship and marriage blew up into a million ugly pieces I bought my husband some new updated Rock n Roll riding jeans.  We were at a big horse competition and it had been years since he updated his wardrobe. They were expensive but he looked very nice in a more modern style of jean versus his old Wranglers.  Our friends all made a big fuss over it too.  It was a lot of fun!  Unbeknownst to me at that time he was seeing another woman and our marriage was about to come to an unexpected and sudden end. About 2 weeks prior to Valentine's day I learned about the lies and cheating and I vividly remember him walking out the door of our house on Valentine's day to spend it with someone other than me....and he was wearing those new jeans that were so special and fun.  Not only would I like to exchange those jeans but I would like you to burn them in a ceremonial kind of way while drinking lots of wine!  ,https://media.rtm.com/thegreatexchange/large/aa45c343-d55b-4e63-9973-bc0f407b4d49.jpeg,https://media.rtm.com/thegreatexchange/large/aa45c343-d55b-4e63-9973-bc0f407b4d49.jpeg,CHEATED
